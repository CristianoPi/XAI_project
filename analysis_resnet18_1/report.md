## 2 Recurring error patterns
The model **resnet18** frequently misclassifies items, particularly in contexts that do not align with the prompt. Common error types include:
- **Misalignment with Context**: Items like bookjackets and notebooks are often confused with unrelated objects (e.g., tools, kitchen items).
- **Over-reliance on Background**: The model tends to focus on the background context rather than the primary object, leading to incoherent predictions.
- **Spurious Correlations**: Certain objects are misclassified due to their association with common contexts (e.g., bathroom items being misidentified in kitchen settings).

### Class `tennis ball` (ImageNet #852)
- **Average Logit**: 2.46 (std: 1.74)
- **Top-5 Activations**:
  - `dataset/images/grannysmith__plain__002.png` → logit=8.10
  - `dataset/images/opaquemetalwaterbottle__green__002.png` → logit=6.96
  - `dataset/images/grannysmith__green__002.png` → logit=6.78
  - `dataset/images/grannysmith__plain__001.png` → logit=6.67
  - `dataset/images/grannysmith__classroom__002.png` → logit=6.25
- **Comment**: The model's confusion between tennis balls and Granny Smith apples suggests a bias towards color and shape similarities rather than accurate object identification.

## 5 Main biases of the model
1. **Contextual Bias**: The model often misclassifies objects based on the background context rather than the object itself, leading to incoherent predictions.
   - *Example*: A bookjacket in a kitchen is confused with kitchen items.
   
2. **Over-reliance on Common Objects**: The model tends to favor common objects in specific contexts, leading to misclassifications.
   - *Example*: Bathroom items are frequently misclassified as toilet seats.

3. **Spurious Correlations**: The model shows a tendency to associate certain objects with others based on superficial features rather than their actual characteristics.
   - *Example*: Granny Smith apples are confused with tennis balls due to color similarity.

## 6 Overall verdict
### Strengths
- **Good performance on common objects**: The model performs well with frequently encountered items.
- **High accuracy in familiar contexts**: When the context aligns with the object, predictions are generally accurate.

### Weaknesses
- **Frequent misclassifications in diverse contexts**: The model struggles with diverse backgrounds and less common objects.
- **High incoherence rate**: A significant percentage of predictions are incoherent, indicating a need for improvement in contextual understanding.

### Reliability Rating: 2/5
