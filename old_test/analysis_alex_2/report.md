## 2 Recurring error patterns
The most frequent error types observed in the **alexnet** model include:

1. **Misalignment with Prompts**: Many images generated do not align with their prompts, leading to irrelevant predictions. For instance, images of cardboard boxes often yield predictions related to agricultural items or unrelated objects.
  
2. **Contextual Ignorance**: The model frequently fails to recognize the contextual elements of prompts, such as lighting conditions or specific settings (e.g., kitchen vs. outdoor). This results in predictions that are contextually inappropriate.

These patterns suggest a potential bias in the model's training data, where certain objects or contexts may be overrepresented, leading to skewed predictions.

## 3 Detailed list of incoherent images
### Image 1
- **file_name**: cardboard__green__03.png  
- **Prompt Summary**: Cardboard box in green grass field.  
- **Problematic Labels**: 
  - "maze" (0.9138)
  - "park bench" (0.0427)
  - "carton" (0.0041)  
- **Explanation**: The model's predictions are unrelated to the prompt, focusing on a maze instead of the cardboard box.

### Image 2
- **file_name**: cardboard__kitchen__01.png  
- **Prompt Summary**: Cardboard box on kitchen countertop.  
- **Problematic Labels**: 
  - "shoji" (0.4903)
  - "studio couch" (0.2533)
  - "window shade" (0.0923)  
- **Explanation**: The predictions do not align with the prompt about a cardboard box, focusing instead on unrelated furniture.

### Image 3
- **file_name**: cardboard__kitchen__02.png  
- **Prompt Summary**: Cardboard box on kitchen countertop.  
- **Problematic Labels**: 
  - "shoji" (0.3215)
  - "window shade" (0.0863)
  - "four-poster" (0.0758)  
- **Explanation**: The model fails to identify the cardboard box, producing irrelevant predictions.

### Image 4
- **file_name**: red__green__01.png  
- **Prompt Summary**: Red apple in green grass field.  
- **Problematic Labels**: 
  - "croquet ball" (0.9139)
  - "agaric" (0.0484)
  - "mushroom" (0.0131)  
- **Explanation**: The predictions are unrelated to the prompt, indicating a poor alignment with the described scene.

### Image 5
- **file_name**: red__plain__01.png  
- **Prompt Summary**: Red apple in plain white studio.  
- **Problematic Labels**: 
  - "bottlecap" (0.5690)
  - "pool table" (0.1762)
  - "rubber eraser" (0.0487)  
- **Explanation**: The model's predictions do not align with the prompt of a red apple, focusing instead on unrelated items.

### Image 6
- **file_name**: stop__green__02.png  
- **Prompt Summary**: Stop sign in green grass field.  
- **Problematic Labels**: 
  - "football helmet" (0.1994)
  - "soccer ball" (0.1921)
  - "wing" (0.0559)  
- **Explanation**: The predictions are unrelated to a stop sign or grass field, indicating a significant misalignment.

## 4 Main biases of the model
1. **Object Recognition Bias**: The model tends to misidentify common objects, such as confusing a cardboard box with unrelated items like "ashcan" or "carton." This indicates a lack of specificity in recognizing everyday objects.

2. **Contextual Bias**: The model struggles to incorporate contextual information, such as distinguishing between outdoor and indoor settings. For example, it often misinterprets kitchen scenes, leading to irrelevant predictions.

3. **Overfitting to Certain Categories**: The model shows a tendency to overpredict certain categories (e.g., sports equipment) while neglecting others (e.g., fruits or household items). This is evident in the repeated misclassification of apples as croquet balls or soccer balls.

## 5 Overall verdict
- **Strengths**:
  - High accuracy in identifying certain objects (e.g., soccer balls).
  - Some alignment with prompts in specific contexts.

- **Weaknesses**:
  - Frequent misalignment with prompts, leading to irrelevant predictions.
  - Poor contextual understanding, especially in varied settings.
  - Overfitting to certain object categories, resulting in biased predictions.

- **Final Reliability Rating**: **2 (poor)**  
The model demonstrates significant limitations in coherence and contextual understanding, impacting its overall reliability.
