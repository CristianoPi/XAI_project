- **Standard deviation of scores:** 0.09
- **Percentage of incoherent images (score < 0.3):** 100%

## 2 Recurring error patterns
- **Foreground vs Background Confusion:** Many images incorrectly identify objects that are not relevant to the main subject (e.g., predicting animals instead of people).
  - **Bias Link:** This may stem from dataset bias where the training data over-represents certain categories (e.g., animals) over others.
  
- **Object Misclassification:** Common misclassifications include predicting food items unrelated to the prompt (e.g., predicting "cheeseburger" for "cheese bread").
  - **Bias Link:** This could be due to pre-training artifacts where the model has learned to associate certain food items with high frequency in the dataset.

- **Contextual Relevance Issues:** The model often fails to connect the context of the prompt with the predicted labels (e.g., predicting "traffic light" for a scene with a person at a crosswalk).
  - **Bias Link:** This suggests a limitation in the model's architecture to understand contextual relationships, possibly due to insufficient training on diverse scenarios.

5. **file_name:** dataset_coco/images/000000108253.jpg  
   **Summary of prompt:** Plate of cheese bread and wine.  
   **Problematic labels:** 
   - "cheeseburger" (0.68)
   - "burrito" (0.10)

6. **file_name:** dataset_coco/images/000000125062.jpg  
   **Summary of prompt:** Teddy bears on shelf.  
   **Problematic labels:** 
   - "ocarina" (0.26)
   - "toyshop" (0.09)
   - "African grey" (0.06)  
   **Explanation:** Predictions focus on animals and unrelated items, not matching the teddy bears or DVDs in the prompt.

7. **file_name:** dataset_coco/images/000000127624.jpg  
   **Summary of prompt:** Train next to station.  
   **Problematic labels:** 
   - "lakeside" (0.25)
   - "dock" (0.10)
   - "castle" (0.06)  
   **Explanation:** Predictions focus on water-related structures, not relevant to trains or city settings.

8. **file_name:** dataset_coco/images/000000143556.jpg  
   **Summary of prompt:** Bikers on motorcycles.  
   **Problematic labels:** 
   - "go-kart" (0.53)
   - "motor scooter" (0.10)
   - "moped" (0.07)  
   **Explanation:** Predictions focus on smaller vehicles, not matching the prompt about bikers on motorcycles.

9. **file_name:** dataset_coco/images/000000165713.jpg  
   **Summary of prompt:** Rusted fire hydrant next to poles.  
   **Problematic labels:** 
   - "cuirass" (0.18)
   - "mailbox" (0.09)
   - "pop bottle" (0.09)  
   **Explanation:** Predictions do not relate to a fire hydrant or poles, indicating a significant mismatch.

10. **file_name:** dataset_coco/images/000000168619.jpg

    **Problematic labels:** 
    - "megalith" (0.19)
    - "alp" (0.13)
    - "yurt" (0.11)  
    **Explanation:** Predictions focus on structures and landscapes, not directly related to a road or field.

## 4 Main biases of the model
1. **Animal Overrepresentation:** The model often predicts animals in contexts where they are not present, indicating a bias towards animal categories in the training dataset.
   - **Example:** Predicting "Indian elephant" for a prompt about horses.

2. **Food Misclassification:** The model frequently misclassifies food items, suggesting a bias in training data that favors certain food categories.
   - **Example:** Predicting "cheeseburger" for a prompt about cheese bread.

3. **Contextual Disconnection:** The model struggles to connect the context of prompts with appropriate predictions, indicating a lack of understanding of scene composition.
   - **Example:** Predicting "traffic light" for a scene with a person at a crosswalk.

## 5 Overall verdict
- **Strengths:**
  - High confidence in predictions (average confidence of 0.9).
  - Ability to recognize a wide range of objects.

- **Weaknesses:**
  - Consistent incoherence in predictions across various prompts.
  - Significant misclassification and contextual relevance issues.
  - Overrepresentation of certain categories leading to biased outputs.

- **Final reliability rating:** 1 (very poor)
